            <h1>The Unblocked Carver - Issue 1</h1>
            <blockquote>“In moments of darkness and pain, remember all is cyclical. Sit quietly behind your wooden door: spring will come again.” - Loy Ching-Yuen</blockquote>
            <h2>Suffering, Art, and Liberation</h2>
            <p>The first of the Buddha's Four Noble Truths is "Dukkha." It means: You will suffer, you will be dissatisfied, you will experience sorrow. We try to avoid it, and often make it worse in doing so!</p>
            <p>What if I told you that in your suffering was hidden the keys to freeing your true creative self?</p>
            <p>This new weekly missive is for anyone looking to access creative flow and never get stuck in low-energy, unmotivated, frustrated, uncreative states of being.</p>
            <p>Through personal art stories, Eastern and Western philosophical traditions, and practical insights, we'll find out what it means to become free. This first issue is also the story of how I came to understand these things.</p>
            <h3>My mother is the person who most encouraged me to be creative.</h3>
            <p>This piece of wood art is for her. It's called Ecology of Time.</p>
            <h2>The Backstory:</h2>
            <p>In 2020, I started this project for my mother. It would take four years, multiple homes, and a global pandemic before it was finished. This journey changed me in profound ways.</p>
            <p>In 2019, I threw up my hands in anguish and dropped out of school. With nearly constant pain in my upper back, I couldn't see how all this essay writing and textbook carrying was leading to a better life.</p>
            <p>With school behind me, I decided to finally pursue one of my long-lost loves: woodworking. I had quietly imagined having my own wood shop since high school, but kept putting it off. Now, here we are in late 2024, and Oakmoss is four years old—a brief, but already complicated history.</p>
            <h2>Turning Points:</h2>
            <p>Just as Oakmoss was taking shape, life threw a curveball. In 2020, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Terrifying news.</p>
            <p>Around that time, I had launched my Etsy store and was working out of a community maker-space where all the tools I could imagine were made available for a monthly membership cost. They even hired me for a summer, but the uncertainty of that time loomed large.</p>
            <p>In December 2019, I remember someone at the shop saying "hopefully that coronavirus doesn't spread here…" We had no clue how much the world would soon change.</p>
            <h2>The Project Begins:</h2>
            <p>Around this time, my uncle saw a gear-shaped drawer box that I made for a friend—someone who was part of the adventures leading to Oakmoss coming into being (Thanks Dusty Rose! The plants have a plan.) Seeing the piece, my uncle had an idea: he commissioned me to make one for my mother while she was going through treatment.</p>
            <p>I saw it as the perfect opportunity to create something beyond the usual commissions.</p>
            <p>I decided to push my limits, envisioning a drawer box with two large wooden gears that would turn in sync when the drawer opened or closed. I wouldn't have attempted such a project for a usual customer. It was a labor of love, an offering to my mother, and a test of my craft.</p>
            <h2>Dukkha, Blocks, Obstacles:</h2>
            <p>What I thought would be a focused project became a long and treacherous journey. Since it began, I've worked in four wood shops, lived in seven homes, and gone through two relationships.</p>
            <p>Through the global pandemic, my mother's illness, and personal upheavals, this piece became my steady anchor—a reminder of patience, resilience, and interpersonal support. Luckily, I have patient family members…</p>
            <h2>Being True to Yourself</h2>
            <p>In September 2020, I faced a tough decision. The maker-space where I worked on my projects and as an employee was going to enforce rules on its paying members that, in my view, violated personal autonomy and harmed the livelihoods of small business owners. If you know, you know. It didn't sit right with me, so I left. I moved all of my projects and tools out of my rented studio. I lost my wood shop access and my job in one breath.</p>
            <p>Looking back, I'm grateful that I made that choice. We've all faced moments when life asks us to choose between our conscience and external pressures.</p>
            <p>This experience taught me about the importance of following my conscience even when it leads to hardship. I believe that standing up for the principles you believe in—not just as an artist, but as a person—is a step toward true creative and spiritual freedom.</p>
            <blockquote>"Being true to yourself is a vital aspect of accessing your creative essence." - Jesse Boyes</blockquote>
            <h2>Suffering and Compassion:</h2>
            <p>Through all of this, I'd been grappling with chronic back pain, a constant since my teenage years. Much emotional turmoil compounded atop the physical pain, and I struggled to hold jobs.</p>
            <p>While my mother was undergoing cancer treatment, I felt hopeless—like I wasn't able to support her and my dad how I wished I could. A lot rested on my father's strength then.</p>
            <p>I was angry and frustrated, but this was cause for deep reflection. The suffering we endured opened me up to a new level of compassion, not just for others, but for myself.</p>
            <h2>"When the student is ready…"</h2>
            <p>Considering the many obstacles, dead ends, social ills, and pains of those years, I feel especially grateful now for what ensued during my time at university. There, Professor Trevor Carolan taught me much about the importance and power of writing. He assigned many readings related to Eastern philosophy.</p>
            <p>A favorite book from that time is Hōjōki, by Kamo no Chōmei. The author describes how decades of continuous disasters and calamities in 13th century Japan led him to live in increasingly small dwellings, and finally a ten by ten foot hut, secluded in the mountains. There's a line that feels particularly relevant here: "If you conform to the world, it will bind you hand and foot. If you do not, then it will think you mad."</p>
            <p>Professor Carolan's mentorship was a big synchronicity, arriving in my life at a crucial time. It wasn’t just a simple teacher-student dynamic. Our conversations about the Yi Jing (The Ancient Chinese Book of Changes), Taoism, dharma, and Jung's ideas on archetypes and synchronicity seemed to unfold as part of a much larger, more profound process.</p>
            <blockquote>“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” - C.G. Jung</blockquote>
            <h2>"Debts and Lessons"</h2>
            <p>At times, I felt like giving up on my tumultuous journey. Loose ends were hanging all around me—projects I couldn’t finish, tasks I couldn’t seem to move forward. I felt caught between the pressure to tie things up and the temptation to abandon them entirely.</p>
            <p>Take, for example, the farmhouse kitchen island I’ve been building for my wood shop landlord. It’s been two years, and it’s still only halfway finished. I felt overwhelmed by the weight of these unfinished commitments. But what I’ve come to realize is that unresolved work isn’t a sign of failure—it’s a reflection of the natural ebb and flow of the creative process.</p>
            <p>There’s grace in acknowledging the unfinished, and through this realization, I’ve found more peace in following through than in running away from my debts, both material and spiritual. Every loose end has taught me something about patience and the value of persistence.</p>
            <p>I've also learned that deadlines aren't compatible with my art, and I don't want my art to be a business! That realization has been incredibly freeing, but I had to suffer first.</p>
            <h2>Resistance:</h2>
            <p>My writing mentor at University, Trevor Carolan, translated (The Book of the Heart? or The Supreme Way?) from the early 20th century Taoist master Loy Ching-Yuen: “In moments of darkness and pain, remember all is cyclical. Sit quietly behind your wooden door: spring will come again.”</p>
            <p>Zen and Taoist philosophy teach that when we surrender our resistance to suffering, we find a kind of liberation. I began to see my creative process in a new light—not as a way to escape suffering, but as a way to transform it.</p>
            <p>When we face suffering in our creative work—whether it’s self-doubt, external pressure, or personal pain—there’s a powerful opportunity hidden in it:</p>
            <p>What if, instead of resisting, we lean into the discomfort? For me, I found that every block in the process was a doorway to something new—an insight, a fresh approach, or a deeper understanding of myself.</p>
            <h2>Resolution</h2>
            <p>Surely you're wondering now when the good news comes in this story. Yes! My mother eventually went into remission! She is now cancer-free, and the joy of that news was a beacon of light during hard times. It can be hard to create when there's a lot of stress and grief in your life, so her recovery also restored the joy in bringing this project to completion.</p>
            <p>On top of that, she's now finding her own creative freedom with her lifelong interest in painting! Her work can be seen here: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/artist_intheworks/">https://www.instagram.com/artist_intheworks/</a></p>
            <h2>Completion and Harmony:</h2>
            <p>It was just now, October of 2024, that I carved out the time to finally complete this piece.</p>
            <p>Finishing Ecology of Time feels like bringing a long and difficult chapter to a close, letting me fully welcome all that comes next. The project—which became the logo of Oakmoss itself—stands as a symbol of everything I've learned: patience, symbiosis, resilience.</p>
            <p>Oakmoss, the name of my wood shop, reflects the spirit of everything I've been through: a resilient symbiosis. Oakmoss itself is a type of lichen—a cooperative relationship between fungi and algae. It’s a perfect metaphor for the creativity and support that has been at the core of this journey.</p>
            <p>I believe creativity is about more than making beautiful objects—it’s about finding harmony in chaos, about transforming suffering into meaning, and about building connections, both internal and external.</p>
            <p>As we move forward in this newsletter journey, I hope to share more stories that explore what it means to live creatively, to work with your hands, and to find freedom in a world that often seeks to limit us. Creativity is liberation, and we’re all in this together.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being here. Let’s continue to unblock and carve together.</p>
            <p>- Jesse</p>
