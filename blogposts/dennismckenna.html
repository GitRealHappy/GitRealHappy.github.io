            <p class="date">Jan 16, 2024</p>
            <p class="author">by <strong>jesseboyes</strong> in Jesse’s Interviews</p>

            <h2>Dennis McKenna Bio</h2>
            <p>Dennis McKenna’s research has focused on the interdisciplinary study of Amazonian ethnopharmacology. He has conducted extensive ethnobotanical fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazon. His doctoral research (University of British Columbia, 1984) focused on the ethnopharmacology of ayahuasca and oo-koo-he, two tryptamine-based hallucinogens used by indigenous peoples in the Northwest Amazon.</p>
            <p>He is a founding board member of the Heffter Research Institute, and was a key organizer and participant in the Hoasca Project, the first biomedical investigation of ayahuasca. He is the younger brother of Terence McKenna. From 2000 to 2017, he taught courses on Ethnopharmacology and Plants in Human Affairs at the University of Minnesota.</p>
            <p>In 2019, in collaboration with colleagues, he incorporated the McKenna Academy of Natural Philosophy. He emigrated to Canada from Minnesota in the spring of 2019 together with his wife Sheila, and now resides in Abbotsford, B.C.</p>

                <h3>JB: How was your recent journey in Peru?</h3>
                <p>DM: It was very good, as most of them are. We had two back-to-back retreats in July. Two different groups — one of them about fifteen people, the other one about eleven. The general sequence is, at least so far, always the same. We do three ceremonies at a ten-day retreat. The first two or three days we just play tourism basically. Everybody gets to Cuzco and we play tourist for a few days and look at some of the major sites. But it’s really important for group dynamics — for friendship, so that by the time you get ready to do the ceremony, everybody is friends, everybody is bonded, and you’re ready to go through this very intense experience.</p>

                <h3>JB: What are you most excited to talk about right now? The McKenna Academy for Natural Philosophy?</h3>
                <p>DM: The Academy, yes. It’s not really separate from all the other things I’m excited about. I want to do things in South America. I want to work with sacred medicines down there. I want to do research there, and all of those opportunities...</p>
