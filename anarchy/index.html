      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Unshackle Your Web Creativity: Escape the CMS Matrix!</p>

      <p class="green-text large-text">Greetings, digital rebel!</p>

      <p class="green-text">I don't know about you, but I couldn't stand being trapped in the one-size-fits-all world of WordPress, Wix, and those other monopolizing media masters. Do the endless plugins, hidden costs, and restrictive templates make you want to pull the plug? It‚Äôs time to break free from the CMS overlords and take control of your web presence!</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Why Settle for Less?</p>

      <p class="green-text">They‚Äôve told you that web design is too complicated... that without their bloated platforms, you‚Äôre lost at sea. They‚Äôve clouded the waters with jargon like ‚Äúpremium features‚Äù and ‚Äúenterprise solutions,‚Äù all while keeping true creative freedom just out of reach.</p>

      <p class="green-text">But here‚Äôs the secret: You‚Äôve been tricked! Web design isn‚Äôt some arcane art reserved for the elite coders of the world. It‚Äôs more accessible than ever, wildly empowering, and (dare I say) a ton of fun!</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Introducing: Web Design for Anarchists</p>

      <p class="green-text">A 2-day, hands-on journey into the heart of web freedom. I'm not just teaching code; I'm starting a revolution against the tyranny of templates and the dictatorship of drag-and-drop. Using your computer through the terminal may seem scary, but soon you'll be stopping bullets mid air, or reprogramming Terminators to send back in time and stop Judgement Day.</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">What You‚Äôll Learn:</p>

      <ul class="green-text list">
        <li><u>Command Line Basics</u>: Conquer the terminal like the true rebel you are. You'll be navigating your file directory like Neo doing kung fu.</li>
        <li><u>HTML & CSS Fundamentals</u>: Craft the web, your way, from the ground up.</li>
        <li><u>Light SEO Tactics</u>: Make sure search engines know WTF they're dealing with.</li>
        <li><u>GitHub Pages & Version Control</u>: Host your custom website for free, no strings (or sneaky footer ads) attached. My website costs me $15CAD per year for the domain name, and that's it.</li>
        <li><u>Mobile Responsiveness</u>: Look stunning on any device‚Äîfrom the smallest phones to the widest screens.</li>
        <li><u>AI-Powered Workflow</u>: Use natural language techniques to leverage AI tools and keep your brain intact.</li>
        <li><u>Philosophy of Digital Autonomy</u>: Embrace a mindset that puts you in the driver‚Äôs seat of your online presence.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">No Coding Experience? No Problem!</p>

      <p class="green-text">I get it. Terms like HTML, CSS, and GitHub can sound like a foreign language. Fear not. I'm breaking everything down to the foundations. Think of me as your guide through the matrix, ensuring you don‚Äôt get lost in the code.</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Does this look complicated?</p>

      <p class="green-text">By the end of the course, code like this will make complete sense to you!</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Empower Yourself</p>

      <p class="green-text">Imagine launching your own custom website‚Äîno templates, no limits, just pure creative expression. You‚Äôll not only have a live, fully functional site but also the confidence to continue evolving your digital skills.</p>
      <p class="green-text">We're at a historical pivot point: If you learn these skills and leverage AI to make stuff happen fast, you'll be building websites in under a day that people would charge $1,000-$2,000 for. If you don't learn these skills and try to do it with just AI, your results will suck.</p>
      <p class="green-text"><strong>Note:</strong> We‚Äôre focusing on HTML and CSS foundations. While I can't turn you into a JavaScript guru overnight, you‚Äôll learn how to sprinkle in interactive features that make your site pop. Browse my other websites to see what you can learn:</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Ready to Join the Rebellion?</p>

      <p class="green-text">This isn‚Äôt just a course; it‚Äôs a movement against the mundane, a stand for creativity, and a leap into digital autonomy.</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize">üî• Limited Seats Available! The revolution doesn‚Äôt wait, and neither should you.</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize">This course will be offered for $100 just ONE TIME in December 2024, for TWO PARTICIPANTS. After that it will become a $600+ bootcamp.</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">PREREQUISITES:</p>

      <div class="prerequisite-box">
      <ul class="green-text list">
        <li><u>Typing</u>: If you can't type over 30 words per minute, it may be tricky to keep up, but this is just a suggestion.</li>
        <li><u>Downloading Software</u>: You'll have some set-up to do before the course, like downloading VS Code or Cursor. You'll get an email guide to get set-up, but these basics should require no hand-holding.</li>
        <li><u>File Management</u>: You should be comfortable with navigating your folders and files in the graphical interface of your computer.</li>
        <li><u>Stable Internet Connection</u>: Look, if you have a power outage I'll work with you on a refund. Just try to be prepared.</li>
        <li><u>Time Commitment</u>: 8 hours of class time and suggested 4 hours available to practice and experiment during breaks/after hours. The course will take place over four two-hour sessions.</li>
        <li><u>Familiar with Zoom</u>: You're attending a course over Zoom calls. You must be prepared to show up, and should be ready to share your screen if you're having trouble.</li>
      </ul>
