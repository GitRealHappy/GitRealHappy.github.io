      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Learn to Build Custom Websites in 48 Hours â€“ With no previous coding experience.</p>

      <p class="green-text">Break free from the paint-by-numbers webpage builders like Wordpress and Squarespace.</p>
      <p class="green-text">Quickly build entire websites on your computer, independantly, that designers would charge $2,000+ for.</p>
      <p class="green-text">100% creative control over every pixel.</p>
<hr>
      <p class="green-text large-text">So:</p>

      <p>
        <ul class="problem-list">
          <li>You've been surprised by monthly/annual fees that add up to more than you expected.</li>
          <li>Your creative vision is stifled by restrictive templates.</li>
          <li>You want to build professional websites, but always thought coding is too complicated.</li>
          <li>You're ready to take your skills to the next level.</li>
          <li>AI tools are generating mediocre results that make you seem like a robot.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Don't trade cage for cage.</p>

      <p class="green-text">Here's the truth: The web design elite want you to believe that you need their expensive and bloated platforms. But real web development isn't rocket science â€“ it's a learnable skill that puts you in complete control of your digital destiny for the long-term.</p>

      <p class="green-text">The basics of front-end web development are not reserved for calculus nerds. They're learnable by anyone with basic computer proficiency and a desire to create.</p>

      <p class="green-text">For years I put up with these tools that were supposed to make web development simple, but made anything other than cookie-cutter websites a total nuisance to build.</p>

      <p class="green-text">I'm not saying these platforms are bad. They're great for some applications. But if you want to build anything more unique, you'll need to break free and learn the basics of HTML and CSS.</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Introducing: Web Design for Anarchists</p>

      <p class="green-text">A 2-day, hands-on journey into the heart of web freedom. I'm not just teaching code; I'm starting a revolution against the tyranny of templates and the dictatorship of drag-and-drop.</p>
        
      <p class="green-text">Using your computer through the terminal may seem scary, but soon you'll be stopping bullets mid air, or reprogramming Terminators to send back in time and stop Judgement Day.</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">What Youâ€™ll Learn:</p>

      <ul class="green-text list">
        <li><u>Command Line Basics</u>: You'll be navigating your file directory like Neo doing kung fu. At least your non-programming friends will think you look like a pro hacker.</li>
        <li><u>HTML & CSS</u>: Coding fundamentals that put you in complete creative control.</li>
        <li><u>Free Hosting & Github Version Control</u>: Keep past versions of your site safely stored, and save $100+ yearly on hosting.</li>
        <li><u>Mobile Responsiveness</u>: Look stunning on any deviceâ€”from the smallest phones to the widest screens.</li>
        <li><u>AI-Powered Workflow</u>: Use natural language techniques to 10x your development speed without rotting your brain.</li>
        <li><u>Philosophy of Digital Autonomy</u>: Embrace a mindset that puts you in the driverâ€™s seat of your online presence.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">No Coding Experience? No Problem.</p>

      <p class="green-text">I know. Terms like HTML, CSS, and GitHub can sound like a foreign language. Fear not. I'm breaking everything down to the foundations. Think of me as your guide through the matrix, ensuring you donâ€™t get lost in the code.</p>

      <p class="green-text emphasize large-heading">Does this look complicated?</p>
