## Jesse James Boyes
### Wood Artist and Author of The Unblocked Carver

> "Trees are full of stories. I carve them."

I'm a woodworker and writer driven by a simple belief: that connecting with our creative power leads to more intentional, fulfilling lives. My wood art reflects nature's wisdom, while my writing explores philosophy, art, and spirituality.

### My Work

Every piece I create tells a story of patience, skill, and respect for the natural beauty of wood. From custom furniture to artistic sculptures, each creation is a testament to traditional craftsmanship in our modern world.

But my passion extends beyond woodworking. I also teach **[The Creative Wayfinder](https://stan.store/oakmoss/p/the-creative-wayfinder)** — a transformative course designed to help people unlock their full creative potential and live with authentic purpose.

### My Writing

I study philosophy, spirituality, and psychology, weaving wild adventure stories into my free letters on living your creative purpose. You can read these insights in **The Unblocked Carver**, my newsletter about [conscious creativity and intentional living](/unblockedcarver/).

### My Vision

My grand vision is to one day build **The Perennial Academy** — a small educational eco-village focused on healing, permaculture, and conscious living. This transformative community will inspire others to create their own spaces of growth and connection.
