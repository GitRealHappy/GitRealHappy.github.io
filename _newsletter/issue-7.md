## True productivity can be counterintuitive.

In Taoist thought, we have the concept of wu-wei—effortless action or 'doing by not doing.' It's the art of aligning with natural forces rather than struggling against them.

Sometimes it's about slowing down and noticing more about your environment, not just summoning inner will-power.

Tai Chi, the martial art of the Taoists, teaches us that energy is charged not through frantic movement, but through deliberate, mindful slowness—a lesson I've been rediscovering in my own space this spring.

## From Desert to Rain: Rediscovering Flow

My recent transition from my adventure in the warm, open desert back to cold and rainy indoor-heavy Canadian life left me feeling physically stagnant and creatively blocked.

My ongoing back pain intensified, and my energy levels plummeted. In response, I began what started as simple spring cleaning but evolved into a study of feng shui: the ancient Chinese practice of harmonizing energy flow through space.

Rather than forcing productivity through sheer will, I made these seemingly small adjustments to my environment:

### Environmental Adjustments

1. Installed a wall-mounted standing desk that folds away when not needed
2. Rotated my mattress 90 degrees and planned for a proper bed frame… (I rent out the bedroom in my one-bedroom suite, so I sleep in the tiny dining room)
3. Repurposed the dormant fireplace area into a compact workbench, freeing up a previously tool cluttered corner.

## Subtle Yet Profound Transformation

The transformation has been subtle yet profound. My mental clarity has improved. The newfound space allows for morning yoga without obstacles. Cleaning has become easier because everything now has an intentional place. As the rain is letting up, the simple pleasure of moving more easily between indoor and outdoor space has restored a sense of flow to my days. The standing desk lets me move my body much more freely while I'm focused on web design, writing, or course building.

In feng shui terms, I've literally removed resistance to the flow of chi. Vital energy. What fascinates me is how this physical reorganization parallels creative unblocking. Slowing down to ask the right questions about my space proved far more effective than charging forward with my mind's default priorities.

The quickest route to a goal sometimes isn't a straight line. Sometimes it involves stepping back, clearing space, and allowing new patterns to emerge.

As I prepare to guide others through creative unblocking in my [upcoming course](https://stan.store/oakmoss/p/the-creative-wayfinder), this physical reminder of energy flow principles couldn't be more timely.

## Where Is Your Chi Stuck?

Is there a space in your home or workplace where the chi is stuck?

Sometimes pausing your "productive" work to ask new questions about your set up is the key to more effective work, or simply spending less energy, and as a result feeling less resistance to working on what matters to you.

Thanks for reading, and let me know if it inspires any adjustments in your space!

Until next time,
