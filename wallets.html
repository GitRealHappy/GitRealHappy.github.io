                <p>Imagine holding a piece of art every time you reach for your wallet. The Oakmoss Wood Wallet isn't just an accessory—it's a handmade carving born from passion and crafted with precision by artisan Jesse Boyes in Abbotsford, BC.</p>
                
                <p>Each wallet is made from premium hardwoods like padauk, birdseye maple, walnut, and cherry. This final production of 25 wallets is extra special, featuring exclusive designs carved and burned onto them. They're the culmination of a journey that began with a simple client request and blossomed into a beloved accessory cherished by over 50 happy customers.</p>
                
                <p>Compact and sleek, the Oakmoss Wood Wallet effortlessly fits into your front pocket or even a shirt pocket. When you're traveling light such simplicity is a relief. The high-quality elastic from Warkov Shafir securely holds anywhere from 1 to 18 cards, adapting to your needs without compromising style or functionality. The genuine leather cash holder tightly grips your folded cash or receipts while granting quick and easy access.</p>

                    <p>"I really like the size and shape of the wallet, which is especially low profile in the clothes I use when making things. It's way less cumbersome than my previous wallet. I'm using it as my business wallet, so it's got my business credit card and things like that."</p>

                <p>This is your chance to own a piece of functional art that seamlessly blends beauty and simplicity. Oakmoss is an art outlet, not a factory. We create when inspiration strikes, and while we've loved crafting these wallets, our journey is evolving. We're making one final run of 25 wallets right now, and they could be the last ever made.</p>

                <p>Priced at an accessible $85, the Oakmoss Wood Wallet offers a tactile experience that's both luxurious and practical. We stand by our craftsmanship with a three-year guarantee on the strap and free local repairs on wood components. Out of over 50 wallets sold, only two have ever needed repair—one of which survived being run over by a van!</p>
